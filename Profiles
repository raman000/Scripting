A profile is a script that runs when PowerShell starts. You can use a profile to customize your environment to, for example, change background colors and errors and do other types of customizations. 
PowerShell applies these changes to each new session you start.

Profile types
PowerShell supports several profile files. You can apply them at various levels, as you see here:

Description             	Path
All users,   all hosts	   $PSHOME\Profile.ps1
All users,  current host	 $PSHOME\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
Current user, all hosts	     $Home[My ]Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1
Current user, current host	 $Home[My ]Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

here are two variables here: $PSHOME and $Home.
$PSHOME points to the installation directory for PowerShell.
$Home is the current user's home directory.
